### Page 1: Inintial Page

On the first page, you can choose from three different regional accents, generalized for certain countries:

- **Con Voseo:** 🇦🇷 🇺🇾 🇵🇾 🇨🇷 🇸🇻 🇳🇮 🇭🇳  
- **Vosotros:** 🇪🇸 🇬🇶  
- **Sin Voseo:** 🇲🇽 🇨🇴 🇻🇪 🇨🇺 🇵🇪 🇨🇱 🇧🇴 🇪🇨 🇵🇦 🇩🇴 🇺🇸 🇬🇹 🇮🇨

#### Here’s how the pronouns differ based on the accent.

## Architecture

### The Backend

**Conjugator** is developed in Python 3.12.6, ensuring compatibility with Python 3.10.x classes, methods, and functions.

The application is built using the Flask micro web framework and runs on the Gunicorn WSGI HTTP server.

For the database, TinyDB is used due to the relatively small number of records that need to be stored. CRUD operations are handled through custom ORM methods.

### The Frontend

The frontend uses Flask's static templates to render HTML, with static CSS files for styling.

To store data such as verb tense names, descriptions, conjugation patterns, and usage examples, TOML files are utilized. This allows for faster and simpler access by the frontend templating engine.

### Prerequisites and Requirements

To run **Conjugator**, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```Flask==3.0.2
Werkzeug==3.0.2
beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
requests==2.31.0
tinydb==4.8.0
tomli==2.0.1
gunicorn==20.1.0
